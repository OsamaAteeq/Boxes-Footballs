# Boxes-Footballs
Boxes play football using ML agents

The project will be unity-based video game called “Boxes & Footballs”. The player will be able to control a team of boxes (one at a time) to get the ball inside the opponent goal post. The opponents will be a team of Machine Learning Agents that will learn from reinforcement learning algorithms and the user’s past plays. The player and the ML agent will have the ability to move in any direction on a plane, jump, dribble the ball, shoot, and pass the ball to a player of the same team.
